//------------- Base for all observations -----------------------------

Element: 		Observation
Concept:		MTH#C1554188
Description:	"A statement about an act that is intended to result in new information about a subject. The focus of an observation can include the subject's behavior, physiological state, functional status, environment, exposures to substances, etc. The method of observing can be via questions, assessment, laboratory test, or imaging procedure."

0..1			TemporalContext

		Element:		ObservationCode
		Concept:		TBD
		Description:	"A term from a controlled vocabulary that defines the data element (the question, not the answer) as specifically as possible. The specific code should always align with the concept of the element, but may be more specific. For example, the concept associated with medications is code for 'medication used', but the ObservationCode is the code for the particular medication used. For tests, ObservationCode identifies the specific test being performed, and for observations, the specific question being asked."
		Value:			Coding

		Element:		ObservationNotMade
		Concept:		TBD
		Description:	"Whether the observation described by the specific concept code was not made (or not ordered). This is the equivalent of 'not asked'. Particularly important if an observation or test is normally ordered, but was not ordered in a particular instance. This is distinct from a missing value, in which the observation was attempted (the question asked), but the value normally resulting from the observation was not obtained (question not answered)."
		Value:			boolean
		
		Element:		ObservationNotMadeReason
		Concept:		TBD
		Description:	"An explanation of why the observation was not made (or ordered), i.e., why the question was not asked."
		Value:			string // TODO: value set

		Element: 		ObservationStatus
		Concept:		TBD
		Description:	"Qualifier describing the stage or administrative state of the observation."
		Value:			Coding from http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/observation-status

		Element:		ObservationCategory
		Concept:		TBD
		Description:	"A categorization of the observation according to how the observation was collected or its clinical area."
		Value:			Coding from http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/observation-category or Coding

	Description:	"Indicator of significant change (delta) from the last or previous measurement."
	Value:			Coding from ChangeFlagVS

	Element:		TestComponent
	Concept:		TBD
	Description:	"A sub-measurement that is part of a larger test result. Component observations are expressed as separate code-value pairs. With the exception of reference range, qualifiers and attributes on the primary measurement apply to the test component. Examples include systolic and diastolic component observations for blood pressure measurement and multiple component observations for genetics observations."
